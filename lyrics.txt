Four carrots, a princess cut
Are you psyched or what?
I just wish I could be there to see
When he gets down on one knee
Omigod, omigod, you guys
Looks like Elle's gonna win the prize
If there ever was a perfect couple
This one qualifies, omigod, you guys
Omigod, this is happening
Our own homecoming queen and king
Finally, she'll be trying on a huge engagement ring for size
Omigod, you guys, omigod
Okay
Everybody signed, good
Now, fall in line
And we'll start the engagement parade
Light candles in single file
Don't forget to smile
Lose the gum Kate, you look like a maid, sorry
Now, prepare to serenade
Omigod, omigod, you guys
Looks like Elle's gonna win the prize
If there ever was a perfect couple, this one qualif'
Omigod, guys, I'm serious
Elle and Warner were meant to be
Not once ever has he hit on me, shut up
There just like that couple from Titanic
Only no one dies, omigod
Two, three, four, daughter of Delta Nu
Soon to be fiancee
Now that a man chose you
Your life begins today
Make him a happy home
Waste not his hard earned wage
And so he does not roam
Strive not to look your age
Still in your hour of need
Let it be understood
No man could super see
Our sacred bond of sisterhood
Omigod, omigod, you guy
Guys, she's not here
Bruiser, where is Elle?
She's doesn't have an engagement outfit?
She's totally freaking out?
She's trapped in the old valley mill?
Oops sorry, the Old Valley Mall
Omigod, that's emergency
Don't take the freeway, hey, wait for me
No one should be left alone
To dress and to accessorize
Omigod, you guys, omigod
Omigod, omigod, omigod, omigod
It's almost there but
This dress needs to seal the deal
Make a grown man kneel
But it can't come right out and say bride
Can't look like I'm desperate or
Like I'm waiting for it
I gotta leave Warner his pride
So bride is more implied, here she is
Omigod, omigod, you guys
All this week I've had butterflies
Every time he looks at me it's totally proposalized
Omigod, you guys, omigod
So, help me dress for my fairytale
Can't wear something, I bought on sale
Love is like forever
This is no time to economize, omigod, you guys
Blondes make commission so easy
Excuse me, have you seen this?
It just came in
It's perfect for a blonde
Right with a half lip stitch on china silk?
But the thing is, you can't use a half lip stitch on china silk
It will pucker and you didn't just get this in
Because I saw it in last May's Vogue
Omigod, omigod, you guys
I'm not about to buy last years dress at this years price
Elle saw right through that salesgirl's lies
It may be perfect for a blonde but I'm not that blonde
I may be in love but I'm not stupid, lady, I've got eyes
Omigod, Elle Woods, sorry, our mistake
Courtney, take your break
Just ignore her, she hasn't been well
Try this, latest from Milan
Go on, try it on, I take care of my best clientele
It's a gift from me to Elle
Omigod, omigod, you guys
This one's perfect and it's just my size
See dreams really do come true
You never have to compromise, omigod
Omigod, omigod, omigod you guys
Let's go home before someone cries
If there ever was a perfect couple this one qualifies
'Cuz we love you guys
No, I love you guys
Omigod, omigod
Omigod you guys, omigod
We both know why we're here
I see it in your eyes
I guess, it calms my fear
To know it's not a surprise
I thought one look at you
Looking like a dream come true
Would leave me speechless
Like you always do
But now, we're wide awake
We've got some plans to make
Let's take some action, baby
So, baby, give me your hand
I've got some dreams to make true
I've got the future all planned
It's time to get serious
Time to get serious with you
I never thought that I
Oh honey, I'm not finished
Oh, sorry
Since, I was two or three
My life was planned out neat
I'd get my law degree, yeah
And then win my senate seat
A big white house back east, oh, oh
All of the amenities, yeah
Three kids, at least
Just like the Kennedy's
Here's where our lives begin
Our lives begin
Just where do you fit in?
Fit me in
I'll break it down now, baby
So, baby, give me your hand
Oh, here's my hand, here's my hand
I've got some dreams to make true
We both have dreams to make true
I'll know that you'll understand
Oh yes, I understand
It's time to get serious, time to get serious with you
Serious, serious
Gotta wake up and take our journey
Serious, serious
I'm telling you as a future attorney, oh, oh
You want the moon and sky
Then take it, don't be shy, hey
Baby, that's why you and I
You and I should break up
Hey, baby, I'll give you my hand, we
What? You're breaking up with me?
I thought you were proposing
Elle, if I'm gonna be a senator when I'm thirty
I'm gonna need somebody, serious
Less of a Marilyn, more of a Jackie, serious
Somebody classy and not too tacky
What?
Okay, that came out wrong
Baby, let's both be strong
I mean, we've known all along
Just shut up, what does that mean
I'm not a Jackie?
I'm not serious? But I am seriously in love with you
Baby, my future's all planned
I've got some dreams to make true
I thought that you'd understand
It's time to get serious, time to get serious, check this
Wait a second, this is the kind of girl Warner wants
Someone serious, someone lawyerly
Someone who wears black when nobody's dead
Girls, I have a completely brilliant plan
What you want, Warner, what you want is me
But you need to see me in a brand new domain
Well, it's plain, Warner in a different setting
You will see you're getting all of this plus a brain
I'll meet you there in Harvard with a book in my hand
Big sturdy book, big wordy book, full of words I'll understand
And right, there is where you'll see it too
Warner what you want is right in front of you
What you want? It's clear
What you want? Right here
What you want? Is right in front of you
Front of you
What you want? It's clear
What you want? Right here
What you want? Is right in front of you
Front of you
Step one, he's off to Harvard Law
So, I get in there too
Step two, make Warner reassess
Impress him with my high IQ
Step three, we throw a great big wedding
And invite all Delta Nu
That's great, nice plan
Now can we think this through, Harvard Law School?
I have a 4.0 average, yeah, in fashion merchandising
What makes you think you can do this?
Love, I'm doing this for love
And love will see me through
Yes, with love on my side, I can't lose
And Harvard can't refuse
A love so pure and true
Don't lawyers feel love too?
Even if they do, what you want
Sweetheart, is no easy thing
If you're going to swing it
It will wreck your senior spring, yeah, it's true
First you'll need an LSAT score of more than 174
So, no more parties for you
You'll need a killer essay or do not even hope
And glowing letters from your betters
Any chance you know the Pope?
Nope, too bad
'Cause that would be a coup
And you've got a lot of work in front of you
What you want? Yes, I know
What you want? Even so
What you want? Is right in front of you
Front of you
What you want? Girl you go
What you want? No really, go
What you want? Is right in front of you
Front of you
Law school? Yes daddy, law school
Good god, why? Law school is for boring
Ugly, serious people and you, button
Are none of those things
What you want, button? Hey, you just say the word
But what you want's absurd and costs a whole lot of swag
And hell, why button, when you can stay right here?
Pursue a film career
How 'bout a nice Burkin Bag?
Yes, the East Coast is foreign
There's no film studios
It's cold and dark, no valet parking
All the girls have different noses
Christ, button, it's like the damn frontier
Tell me what's out there
That you can't get right here?
Guys, love, I'm going there for love
A love I have to win, I can live without sun or valet
I can't just walk away
Betray what might have been
Mind, okay, I'll pay your way if you get in
What you want? Make the grade
What you want? And it's paid
What you want? Is right in front of you
Front of you
Hey, everybody, it's the Spring Fling Beer Bash Extreme
Extreme, not for you
Time to study, go
This year's theme, Jamaican me crazy
What you want?
You wanna be out
Because the sun, she warm
What you want?
You wanna be study
Stuck inside your dorm
What you want?
You wanna be party
With us all night long
What you want?
You wanna be strong
Be strong, oh
134, not good enough
Try again, go
What you want?
You wanna be groovin'
Bumpin', shake da room
What you want?
You wanna be provin' somethin'
And ta whom?
What you want?
You wanna be wonderin'
Where your youth is gone?
What you want?
You wanna hold on
Hold on
151, still not Harvard material
Once again, go
What you want?
(Love, I'm doing this for love)
You wanna be breathin' in the healthy air
What you want?
(And that's how I'll survive)
You wanna be chasin' him and he don't care
What you want?
You wanna ignore the pity in their looks
(Here you go)
What you want?
(I said no, go away)
You wanna say, "Sorry, gotta hit me books"
What you want?
You wanna be sittin' like a lonely child
(Right here is where I'll stay)
What you want?
You wanna be drivin' all da fellas wild?
(Until that happy day)
What you want?
You wanna be feelin' good to be alive
(That day I hear them say)
175, 175, 175, 175, 175
And so, gentlemen, Harvard Law grants admission
To Adam Cohen and Sandeep Padamanan
And now, Miss Elle Woods
Who was kind enough to send in a head shot
We should admit her for reasons of
Multi-culturisim, oh, gentlemen, please, get a hold of yourselves
Oh, look at that, oh, what a shame
She didn't bother sending in a personal essay
How's this for a personal essay?
What you want? Goodness me
What you want? Security
What you want? Is right in
Who are you?
I'm what you want
Harvard, I'm the girl for you
And to prove it's true, we all flew here on Jet Blue
Thank you, thank you
This is what Elle Woods inspires
Everyone admires her
And Harvard should too
This is not a personal essay
No, an essay's so boring and so much does not fit
So, we're appearing live right here
Making clear you must admit that Elle Woods should join
The chosen few, Harvard what you want is right in front of
May I approach
Aha, oh yeah, go Elle
Now see here, Miss Woods
You can't just can't barge in here with singing and dancing
And ethnic movement, this is a very flashy presentation
But I still don't see one reason to admit you
How about love? You ever been in love?
'Cause if you have, you'll know
That love never accepts a defeat
No challenge it can't meet, no place it cannot go
Don't say no to a woman in love, don't laugh when I say love
Don't think that I'm naive because even a person who's smart
Can listen to their heart, can listen and believe
So, believe in what love can achieve
Do you believe? I do
Do you believe? Me too
Yes, we believe in love, how 'bout you?
Welcome to Harvard
What you want? Now, we're set
What you want? Let's go get
What you want? Is right in front of you
Front of you
What you want? Now, we're done
What you want? With step one
What you want? Is right in front of you
Front of you
What you want? What you want?
What you want? What you want?
Hello, I'm Emmett Forrest
Welcome to the hallowed halls of Harvard Law
Let's go around and share a bit about yourselves

Aaron Sholtz, I won a full bright and a rose
I write financial software codes
But that's a challenge I've outgrown
How many yachts can one man own?

Some say that I'm a pompous creep
Somehow I don't lose that much sleep
Why bother with false modesty?
Harvard's the perfect place for me

Pretty impressive, good to know
Welcome to Harvard
What's up? Yo

Sandeep Agrawal Parmadhan, but you may call me, "Your majesty"
In my country, my word was law
But then I flee
Because of stupid coup d'etat

But here I learn
I make new friends
And soon return
In bullet proof Mercedes Benz

Pretty impressive, good to know
Welcome to Har

Enid Hoops, I did the peace corps overseas
Inoculating refugees
In family clinics that I built myself
For mod entries

I bought to clean up their lagoons
And save their rare endangered loons
And led a protest march against insensitive cartoons

Pretty impressive, good

But now I'm on the legal track
Because this country's out of whack
And only women have the guts to go and take it back

We'll make the government come clean
And get more people voting green
And really stick it to the phallus of the war machine

I love your top, it is so petite chick
Anyone know where I can find Criminal Law 101
With Professor Callahan and Warner Huntington the Third?
It's in Houser over there, second building on the left
Thanks

I won a full bright and a rose
I write financial software codes
Why bother with false modesty?
Harvard's the perfect place for me
Harvard's the perfect place for me

Warner, excuse me
Pardon me
Comin' through

Harvard's the perfect place for me
Pretty impressive, good to know
Welcome to Harvard
Elle? Omigod, Warner? I totally forgot you go here

Now when you choose a law career
The moment you embark
There is that joke you're bound hear
A lawyer is a shark

Ignore that, it's simplistic and it's dumb
Only some of you will turn out sharks, just some
The rest are chumps

Our topic is blood in the water
Kids, it's time you faced
Law school is a waste
Oh yes, unless you acquire a taste for

Blood in the water
Dark and red and raw
You're nothing until the thrill of the kill
Becomes your only law

Mr. Sholtz, hypothetical question
Would you be willing to defend
The following banker accused of fraud?

A kind old grandma took her savings and she sent it
Off to your client, all she saved since she was born
Well, he promised to invest it, but he spent it
On prostitutes and heroine and porn

No, I would not want to take that case

Wrong this one is a win unless you're lazy
Grandma's broke, she'll have some hack from legal aid
Put her on the stand and call her old and crazy
Your guy goes free and he can get you high and laid

Look for the blood in the water
Read your Thomas Hobbs
Only spineless snobs
Will quarrel with the morally dubious jobs

Yes, blood in the water
Your scruples are a flaw

Ms. Hupes, hypothetical question
Would you be the right lawyer for the following client?

Say, they offer you a bundle for defending
A famous hit man for the mafia elite
Seems he missed his chosen prey
Killed a nun and drove away
Running over three cute puppies in the street

What, you think I wouldn't defend him
Just because he's a typical man?
Oh, you lesbians think you're so up top

Oh dear, I fear my comment has offended
Hard to argue, though, when you're too mad to speak

Your employment will be very quickly ended
When they see how your emotions make you weak

So what's my point? I run a billion dollar law firm
And I hire four new interns every year
From this class I will select four young sharks whom I respect
And those four will have a guaranteed career, do you follow me?

So I wanna see, what?
Blood in the water
Exactly, let the games begin
Four of you will win

But just those four with the dorsal fin
Yes, blood in the water
So fight and scratch and claw

Yes, Miss Woods, Elle Woods
Someone's had their morning coffee
Would you summarize the case
Of State of Indiana v Hurn in your reading, please?

Oh, I wanted to answer the puppy question?
But I'm asking you about the assigned reading
Okay, who assigns reading for the first day of class?
You have guts, Miss Woods, Miss Kenzington

Let's say you teach a class at Harvard Law School
A position that you're justly proud of
But a girl on whom you call hasn't read the case at all
Should you let it go or?

No I'd throw her out
All right, then, you have heard your classmate
You have just been killed, she cut your throat, so grab your coat
Yes, you've got guts but now there's spilled your
Blood in the water

So would you please withdraw and if you return
Be ready to learn or is it unfair?
Oh, wait I don't care, that's just how I roll
In life and in school with fear and shock and gall

You're nothing until
Blood in the water
The thrill of the kill
Blood in the water

Becomes your only law
Blood in the water
Your only law
Blood in the water

Your only law
Blood in the water
Blood in the water

Honey, whatcha cryin' at?
You're not losing him to that
Both her hair and shoes are flat
Why is she so rude?

Wipe your tears, it's no big thing
You were meant to wear his ring
Cheer up, chin up
It's time to bring a happy attitude

Keep it positive
And slap her to the floor
Keep it positive
As you pull her hair and call her whore

You can take her in a fight
You and he will reunite
You know we're right
We're positive, kill her

Girls, girls, violence is never wise
Not the way to win that guys
Anyway she's twice my size
Who's gotta plan B?

Oh, me, look at her, she's like a nun
Showin' you are way more fun
Bust out the lap dance and you won
You offed the hizzle, gee, what?

Keep it positive
Yeah, let out your inner freak
Keep it positive
Miss. Prissy Pants won't last a week

You will whet his appetite
You and he will reunite
You know we're right
We're positive, we're positive, we're positive, we're posi

Oh, my god, you're making me sick
Are we?
Warner, let's take this back to my place
Aah, hey, hey, hey, be positive

That he loves you and not her
The hot tub

And the betchyas'
Not her, she don't know the real him

You feel him
So, don't her her steal him
Wake him up like sleepin' beauty
Turn his head with your red hot booty

You bring the noise and you bring the funk
It's positively can't do, shake your junk
Shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, whoo

Girls, how is this helping?
He's not even here
He left while we were shaking junk
Wait

Girls, I'm positive
That we've taken this to far
No, I'm positive
This is Harvard not a stripper bar

All this trashy carrin' on
That's the reason now he's gone
I need a salon

Girls, I'm positive
Try not to get upset
But I'm positive
It's time for me to go brunette, what?

Being blonde and being hot
That got me exactly squat
Gotta to show him
I've got more to give

No, I'm positive
Being positive
I'm positive
Being positive
I'm positive
Being positive, being positive, positive

Elle! Do you know the number one reason
Behind all bad hair decisions? Love!
You're lost without your love
You're heart is on the floor

I can help you, I've been there before
When I need to relax I just put on some tracks
From this CD I bought for the store
Isn't that relaxin'? It's called Celtic Moods!

When I'm lonely or feeling dejected
I play this and it never fails
I pretend like I'm in Ireland
With Enya and the whales

When my telephone gets disconnected
Or I spend every night alone
I pretend like I'm in Ireland
Where the Irish bagpipes drone

Smell the grass as a rainstorm is endin'
People smile while I stroll pass their farms
With a red headed sailor named Brenden
And we dance without moving our arms

In bar once I met this guy, Dewey
And he bought me like fourteen beers
And he told me that he was from Ireland
So I lived with him ten years

If I squinted he looked like my sailor
Through my boozy delusional fog
But he dumped me for some slut named Kayla
Took my trailer and took my dog

In Ireland they know how to love you
You embrace in the misty Irish breeze
And if your Irish boy tires of you
You're allowed to shoot him in the knees

Hey, you look like that poster for Ireland
Long blonde hair and that sweet sunny face
Oh no, wait that's the poster for Sweden
Oh, screw it, I'll never see either place

But a girl sweet as you has a future
You have hope as each new day dawns
Girls like you always get to see Ireland
Give my love to the leprechauns

Elle, if a girl like you can't win back her man
Then there is no hope for the rest of us
You go and you fight for him

The Irish fear nothing and no one
They keep fightin' till everyone's dead
I'm not sure where this metaphor's goin'
I just felt like it had to be said

There's a guy at that party who loves you
Something most of us only dream of
You go out there and you get some Ireland
The country of whiskey and love

I still can't believe you're here at Harvard
Back at U.C.L.A., I never would have guessed it
Sometimes, I miss the old days

Those parties, senior year, I thought we ruled the world
You funded all that beer, I held your head when you hurled
We were like gods back then, walking among common men
Tell me, why can't it be that way again?

Dreams don't just disappear
We could keep on dreaming them here
What?
Like senior year but funner

You've got your future all planned
Yes I do, yes I do
What if I'm standing there too?
Wait now, I'm not following you

I'm here 'cause I understand
Not sure, I understand
I'm here 'cause I'm serious
Yeah, right, you look real serious

Woah, Elle, what's up doc?
Love, excuse me?
I put my faith in love
I followed where it led

Love led you here?
To my personal circle of hell
It has not worked out well
I wish that I were dead

'Cause instead of a wedding and love
I'm flunking out of school, a total laughingstock
Someone, he and his friends can just mock
So, go on, here's my head, just hit it with a rock

Wait, go back
You came out here to follow a man?
Harvard Law was just part of that plan?
Man, what rich romantic planet are you from? Malibu?

Instead of lying outside by the pool
You stalk some guy to an Ivy League school?
That's the weirdest reason I
Well, why'd you come?

Okay, I grew up in the Roxbury slums
With my mom and a series of bums
Guys who showed me all the ways a man can fail

I got through law school by busting my ass
Worked two jobs, in addition to class
So, forgive me for not weeping at your tale

Oh well, excuse me
Just because you've got some
Kind of chip on your shoulder
You know what? You're right

There's a chip on my shoulder and it's big as a boulder
With the chance I've been given, I'm gonna be driven as hell
I'm so close I can taste it, so, I'm not gonna waste it
Yeah, there's a chip on my shoulder, you might wanna get one as well

I'm sorry, but that sounds highly negative
Wait, two jobs plus law school? How do you do it?
Well, I don't go to parties a lot, not good use of the time that I've got
Can't spend hours doin' my hair and stayin' in shape
I don't spend hours

But I know it'll all be worthwhile
When I win my first lucrative trial
And buy my mom that great big house out on the cape
Oh, that's so sweet

No, that's the chip on my shoulder, I hugged my mom and told her
With the chance I've been given, I'm gonna be driven as hell
Though I can't take the day off, I just think of the payoff
You need a chip on your shoulder, Little Miss Woods comma Elle

I just need to prove to everyone that I'm serious
What you need is to get to work
Where are your law books?
Well, I know they're here somewhere

You know, this vanity's real picturesque
But it started its life as a desk
Clear it off and find some room for books instead
What are you doing?

Can you live without this?
Can you live without that?
I don't know what this is
It's for hair, wear a hat

Spend some time improving what's inside your head
Out, out, put it in storage, sell it on eBay, leave it behind
Out, out, what, are you angry? Good, so get angry
You may find the chip on your shoulder

Ooh, the room just got colder, hey
But with the chance you've been given
Why are you not driven as hell?

There's just no way around it
You gotta plow through till you found it
Been reading it hard, I can tell

â€~Tis a gift to be simple, â€~tis a gift to be free
Bye, Warner, have a great Thanksgiving
Say, hi to your Mom and dad for me
And Grandma Bootsie

Define, 'Malum prohibitum'
'Malum prohibitum' is an act prohibited by
Prohibited by law like jaywalking
Or chewing gum in Singapore

Therefore, 'Malum in se'
Is an action that's evil in itself
Assault, murder
White shoes after Labor Day

Good, where are you going?
Home, of course, it's Thanksgiving break, remember?
Interesting, what?
Well, I predict you will probably pass

Yes, in the bottom percent of your class
What? If you're going for mediocre?
You've done great
That's not fair

Look, they laughed at me like they're laughing at you
We can't win, if we don't follow through
Might I venture, your vacation plans can wait
Why do you always have to be right?

Gloria, in excelsis Deo
Bye, Warner, Merry Christmas
Enjoy Vail

Emmett, for you
Not as good as going home for Christmas
But, you are too sweet
It's a real time saver, shampoo and conditioner in one

Thank you, you are so adorable to think of me
Elle, hey, Warner, have you seen Vivian?
I have been looking for her everywhere
Yeah, I, I mean no

Great, we're gonna miss our flight
Elle? I don't know if you've noticed before
But each time Warner walks through the door
Your IQ goes down to forty, maybe less

Though it's hardly my business to say
Could it be the real thing in your way
Is the very guy you're trying to impress

Yes, I've been smiling and sweet
And thoroughly beaten, blowing my chance
Let's not chase him away
Let's face him and say, "Hey punk, let's dance"

This chip on my shoulder
Makes me smarter and bolder
No more whining or blaming
I am reclaiming my pride

Grab that book and let's do this
Instead of doodling hearts all through this
Now there's a chip on my shoulder
Let's see him knock it aside

Ah, daughter of Delta Nu
Show him that you're no fool
Daughter of Delta Nu
Go back to school with a big chip on your shoulder

Mr. Ladimer was clearly within his rights to ask for visitation
Without his sperm, the child in question wouldn't exist
Now you're thinking like a lawyer

Yes, Miss Woods
Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point
But did the defendant keep a log
Of every sperm emission made throughout his life?

Interesting, why do you ask?
Well, unless the defendant attempted to contact every sexual encounter
To find out if a child resulted from those unions
He has no parental claim over this child whatsoever
Why now? Why this sperm? I see your point

And by Mr. Huntington's standards
All masturbatory emissions where
The sperm was clearly not seeking an egg
Would be called reckless abandonment

Miss Woods, you just won your case
Omigod
Wait, hold on, we just won the case
Omigod, Elle got all up in Warner's face
Omigod, I am starting to like this place

Yes, omigod
Miss Woods, excellent work today
I assume you're applying for my internship, do you have a resume?
I am one step ahead of you
Here you go and thanks in advance for your consideration

Dear God, it's scented
Three months ago, I would have recycled this
Make sure to put it on file

Guess, she got a chip on her shoulder
Maybe some wise man told her
With the chance we've been given
We gotta be driven as hell

She was something to see there
I'm just happy I could be there
First big test and she aced it
She's so close, she can taste it

She got a chip on her shoulder
Guess, you never can tell
With little Miss Woods comma Elle

Elle Woods, Woods comma Elle
Chip on her shoulder
Elle Woods, Woods comma Elle
Chip on her shoulder

No you never can tell
Elle Woods, Woods comma Elle
Chip on her shoulder
With little Miss Woods comma Elle

All of this time I planned I'd be patient and
You would love me again
You'd come to respect my mind and at last you'd find
You could love me again

And I have turned my whole world upside down
Trying not to let you go
Watching you walk away is like a fatal blow

Whoa! Is that my name up on that list?
Does someone know that I exist?
Is this a mistake? Am I even awake?
Pinch me now to make sure

Ow! Yes, that's my name in black and white
Maybe I'm doing something right
Wow! I feel so much better than before

Warner, sorry I've been a pest
But I guess my best was not working with you
But looks like I've found a cure
And I so look forward to working with you
What? Working with who?

Hey, remember when we spent spring break
In the hot tub every night
We said nothing else could ever feel so right
Well, this might!

Seeing my name up on that list
That beats the first time that we kissed
You thought I was dumb
But I think that somebody's judgment was poor

Seeing my name in black and white
It's like making love with you all night
No wait, it feel so much better, hello, much better
It's oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, much better
'Cause I am so much better than before

Yes, she's so much better than before
Yes, she's so much better than before

Maybe she's what you prefer
But hey, last year I was her
Maybe you will change your mind
But you might look up to find

I've gone on to better things
Better jobs or bigger rings
I don't have the time to cry

I'm too busy loving my name up on that list
Kind of a cool, ironic twist
Who else can I tell? Hoo! Wait, where's my cell?
Mom will fall on the floor

Hey mom!
Look at my name in black and white
Your daughter's doing something right
I feel so much better

I'll be there on Monday, 9 o'clock
And we will see who walks the walk
No, no, I can't wait, I will be there at 8
When they unlock the door

Oh, oh! I'll even dress in black and white
See, I have not begun to fight
And you'll go, oh, much better and oh, much better
And soon all y'all gotta know much better

I am so much better
I am so much better
I am so much better than before!

Hi, I'm Brooke Windham and welcome back
To the, 'Windham Workout Disk 2 Challenge'
And our daily commitment to being the best that we can be
So, grab your, 'Cardio Whip 5000'
'Cause if you want to get ripped, you've gotta get whipped

Do you want an easy miracle?
Do you want to lose a pound or two?
Then you can turn this off right now
My workout's not for you

I'm talking to the woman who wants it all
Gotta pay for what you get
'Cause size 2 clothes don't come to those
Too lazy to sweat

I want you whipped into shape
When I say jump, say "How high?"
You'll know you're doing it right
When you start to cry

If you don't look like you should
You've got to whip it, whip it, whip it good
I'm sorry, ladies, no escape
Till you're whipped into shape

Come on, Sabrina, you halfer, work it out
Whipped into shape
I hate you, Brooke and I love you for it
Whipped into sh
Hey, why'd you pause it?

We have a lot to cover
Meet our brand new client, Brooke
You can laugh, but she's made tons
Off her DVDs and book, "Whip Your Way to Tighter Buns"

Happily married, so she swears
To her sixty year old stud
Till stepdaughter came downstairs
And found Brooke all covered in his blood

If Brooke took a plea
I'd have her out in 3 to 4
But she claims she did not kill him
Did she? Let's watch some more

But it's more than just a workout
It's a defensive weapon too
Simply wrap it round your assailant's neck
And pull till he turns blue

You can also use the patented handle grip
To shatter your attacker's spine
And all for three small payments of
$1999

You'll have him whipped into shape
When you get grief from a guy
Just work him over with this
Till he starts to cry

If he don't act like he should
You've got to whip it, whip it, whip it good
It gets you out of any sway
It gets you whipped into shape

Come on, people
Whipped into shape
What does not kill us makes us hotter
Hands? Who thinks she's guilty?

Okay, now here is where you kids come in
Brooke has trouble trusting me
I'm her only chance to win
But I don't speak MTV

Though Brooke won't help her own defense
She may listen to her peers
Go and place a little sense
In the space between her ears

I'm a Delta, not now
I want her whipped into shape
If there's a brain in that hair
Tell it that I am the key
It's a plea or the chair

See when I talk to her I
Get neither plea nor plan nor alibi
To quote from our defendant's tape
I want her whipped into shape

To the jail
Ladies, just because we're at Boston Women's Correctional Facility
Does not mean we can't become the best that we can be
Here we go

Circle, circle, under, over through, around again, good
Circle, circle, under, over through, around
All right, ladies, we can't break out of here
But we sure can break a sweat

Left, right, left, right, good
Left, right, left, right, left, right
Work it out

I want you whipped into shape
When I say jump, say "How high?"
You know you're doing it right
When you start to cry

If you don't look like you should
You've got to whip it, whip it, whip it good
Like prison, ladies, no escape
Till you're whipped into shape

Whip it, whip it
Whipped into shape
Whip it, whip it
Swipe it, swipe it, swipe it through, check it out, double jump
Swipe it, swipe it, swipe it through, check it out, double jump

That's right, you've got it
Whip it, whip it, whip it
Get whipped into shape

What is this place?
It's called a department store
It's, it's beautiful

First a deep breath, take it all in
Feel all those halogens warming your skin
Smell how they pump in pure oxygen
See, they care

Love, excuse me?
Love, the new fragrance from Chanel
Oh, no thank you

I know you're scared, nevertheless
Think of the people you want to impress
Swallow your pride for me
Just not, yes and prepare 'cos some thing's in the air

I think it's love
Exactly

Here, you'll become what you're supposed to be
You think you can't but you can
Think of the guy you want most to be
Here's your chance to make it so take it like a man

What does she want, not really sure?
Why can't we leave things the way that they were?
Why can't I never say no to her?
What's that smell?

Subtext by Calvin Klein

That I don't like, that's kind of neat
Guys who wear that, get beat up on my street
Still I've come this far, I can't retreat in my shell
I'm in the hands of Elle, what the hell

Here, you'll become what your supposed to be
You think you can't but you can
Think of the guy you want most to be
Here's your chance to make it so take it like a man

God, I love shopping for guys
Okay, this is strange
Watching them change right before my eyes
Don't watch me change

Look at him striking a pose
His confidence grows
He'll bloom like a rose
It's just clothes

God, I love shopping for men
Okay, this is nice
And what walk in at two, they walk out of ten
Is this the price?

Don't worry this is my treat
There's someone I'd like you to meet
Whoa, I look like Warner
Yeah, but it's just me

That's the best part, the outside is new
But now it reflects what's already in you
Couldn't change that if I wanted to
And I do not, thank you, no, thank you

This is no gift, it's payment in kind
'Cause you saw behind all the blonde to my mind
Oh, we've got to buy this, What are you blind?
You look hot, is he not hot? He's hot, hot, hot, hot

Here, you'll become what your supposed to be
You think you can't but you can
Think of the guy you want most to be

Not quite, the guy I did chose to be
Not when she's standing so close to me
I think I like her breath

Here's your chance to make it
Your chance to make it
So take it like, so take it like a man
A man, a man, a man

Look at my ass, look at my thighs
I'm catnip to the guys
They chase my tail, they drool and pant
Wanna touch this but they can't

No, all the boys want to come and play
Snap my fingers and they obey
Why do they follow me 'round all day?
Watch me while I walk away

I bend and snap, feel how hot it's gettin'
Bend and snap, then when you got 'em sweatin'
Spring the trap, they cheer and clap
No tight end can defend 'gainst the bend and snap!

Oh, that's easy for you to say!
And you!

Girl, if you wanna make the team make some self-esteem
The more you jump around and scream the sexier as you seem
Please, sorry girl, that ain't how I play this wouldn't work if I tried all day
I gotta go get my asthma spray, watch me while I walk away
No wait before you walk away

Just bend and snap, ow, look how good you're gettin'
Bend and snap, I'm bettin' right now you sweatin'
Spring the trap, they cheer and clap
So depend on your friend, c'mon an' bend and

It's not the time to overthink
Just try it once he'll buy you a drink
Excuse me, would you teach me that?
I'm tired of living alone with my cat
Sure!

Nowadays I do dye jobs and curls
But here is how we did it in the Laker girls
Look, do it and we'll go away
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Bend and snap! Damn!

Hey, wait a second when I beckoned
Look how the guys came runnin'
Like I'm chicken finger lickin'
Like I'm friggin' wicked stunning

Will you pay for stuff I buy?
Yes!
And bake me cake and pie?
Yes!
And hold me when I cry?
Yes!
Yes, and I will tell you why
Why?

I'm too rockin' to lock away
All the boys come to dock away
Droppin' jaws from a block away
Watchin' how I walk away
We love to watch her walk away

I bend and snap
Now, look how hot it's gettin'
Bend and snap
I bet right know you're flirtin'
Spring the trap, they cheer and clap

I depend on my friend
Go Paulette, go Paulette
I depend on my friend
Go, go, go Paulette
I depend on my friend for the bend and snap

Bend and snap!
Bend and snap!
Bend and snap!
Bend and snap!

Bend and snap!
Bend and snap!
Bend and snap!
I'm gonna get me some Kyle
Paulette, did I leave my stylus?

Bend and snap
No! Oh, crap!

There, right there
Look at that tan, well tinted skin
Look at the killer shape he's in
Look at that slightly stubbly chin
Oh please, he's gay, totally gay

I'm not about to celebrate
Every trait could indicate
The totally straight expatriate
This guy's not gay, I say, not gay

That is the elephant in the room
Well, is it relevant to assume
That a man who wears perfume
Is automatically medically fay?

But look at his quoft and crispy locks
Look at his silk translucent socks
There's the eternal paradox
Look, what we're seeing, what are we seeing?
Is he gay? Of course, he's gay or European?

Gay or European?
It's hard to guarantee
Is he gay or European?
Well, hey don't look at me

You see, they bring their boys up
Different in those charming foreign ports
They play peculiar sports
In shiny shirts and tiny shorts

Gay or foreign fella?
The answer could take weeks
They will say things like, "Ciao, bella"
While they kiss you on both cheeks
Oh please

Gay or European?
So many shades of gray
Depending on the time of day, the French go either way
Is he gay or European or live right there?

Look at that condescending smirk
Seen it on every guy at work
That is a metro-hetro jerk
That guy's not gay, I say no way

That is the elephant in the room
Well, is it relevant to presume that a hottie in that costume
Is automatically, radically, ironically, chronically
Certainly, curtainly, genetically, medically gay?
Officially gay, officially gay, gay, gay, gay

Dammit, gay or European?
So stylish and relaxed
Is he gay or European?
I think his chest is waxed

But they bring their boys up different
There it's culturally diverse
It's not a fashion curse
If he wears a kilt or bears a purse

Gay or just exotic?
I still can't crack the code
Yet, his accent is hypnotic
But his shoes are pointy toed

Gay or European?
So many shades of gray
But if he turns out straight
I'm free at eight on Saturday

Is he gay or European?
Gay or European?
Gay or Euro?

Wait a minute
Give me a chance to crack this guy
I have an idea I'd like to try
The floor is yours

So, Mr. Argitacos
This alleged affair with Ms. Windam
Has been going on for? Two years
And your first name again is? Nicos

And your boyfriend's name is? Carlos
I'm sorry, I misunderstand
You say boyfriend
I thought you say best friend, Carlos is my best friend

You bastard, you lying bastard
That's it, I no cover for you, no more
Peoples, I have a big announcement
This man is gay and European

Whoa, and neither is his place
You've got to stop your being a completely closet case
It's me, not her he's seein'
No matter what he say

I swear, he never ever, ever swing the other way
You are so gay, you big parfait
You flaming boy in cabaret

I'm straight
You were not yesterday
So if I may, I'm proud to say

He's gay and European
He's gay and European
He's gay and European and gay

Fine okay, I'm gay
Hooray

Take back the books and pack up the clothes
Clear out the room and drop off the key
Leave what's left of my dignity
Get in the car and just go

Chalk it all up to experience
They say I'd fail but I disagree
Who could say when
Where my path would lead

But now I know, back to the sun
Back to the shore, back to what I was before
Back where I'm known
Back in my own, very small pond

Laugh with my friends when I arrive
We'll drop the top and just drive
That's fine with me, just let me be
Legally blonde

Thanks for your help and for all you've done
Thank you for treating me decently
What's wrong?
Maybe someday you can visit me
Give me a call, say, hello
Wait, where are you going?

Sorry, I'm letting down everyone
What brought on this?
You think you're best with a hopeless case
That's ludicrous

You are the best thing about this place
Elle, you should know
Callahan hit on me
He what?

He kissed me, he fired me
There's no reason for me to stay
What about love? I never mentioned love
The timing's bad, I know

But perhaps, if I made it more clear
That you belong right here
You wouldn't have to go
'Cause you know that I'm so much in love

Back to the sun, back to the shore
Back to what I was before
Oh, please open the door

Back on the beach, dream within reach
Don't stray beyond
We both long for words so much more
Some girls fight hard, some face the trial
Some girls were just meant to smile

If you can hear, can I just say
How much I want you to stay
It's not up to me, just let me be
Legally blonde

I need you to stay
It's not up to me, just let me be
Legally blonde

Maybe, Warner saw a blonde
Who was sleeping her way to the top
But I see a woman who doesn't have to

I used to pray for the day you'd leave
Swore up and down, you did not belong
But when I'm wrong then I say I'm wrong
And I was wrong about you, so listen up

I see no end to what you'll achieve
That's only if you don't turn and run
You've proved it to me now show everyone
What you can do and you look great in dark blue

Get back in the game, back on the case
Take a good look at my face
I'm not a fool and as a rule
I do not fight, never known her to fight

But I see a star, you're my new muse
You've got the best friggin' shoes
And you lit a fuse, so go show 'em
Who's legally blonde

Yes, you lit a fuse, so go show 'em
Who's legally

Sorry Vivian, I'm never wearing that again
Honey, you're in the supply closet
I know, I said, I'm never wearing that again
I'm wearing this

Back in the game, yes
Back to the trial, yes
But I'm going back in my style
Back in her style

Girls it's a fact, yes
When you're attacked, yes
Gotta respond
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta respond

Hand me my dog, dog
Hand me my bag, bag
And that American Flag
Proud to be American

As nobody screws, no?
Nobody who's, who?
Legally blonde

Get on your feet 'cause she's legally blonde
Take to the street 'cause she's legally blonde
There's no retreat when you're legally blonde, yeah

Don't be afraid to be legally blonde
Join the parade 'cos she's
Honey look, she's leading a parade
Mom and dad? Get a picture

Just one more piece 'cos she's legally blonde
Everyone say cheese, no say, legally blonde
Legally blonde

'Cos she's legally blonde
'Cos she's legally blonde
'Cos she's legally blonde

Oh my God, Elle
Thanks, great chorus, but I don't need voices in my head today
Honey, it's us, the girls of Delta Nu
We came to see our president be legally blonde

She's gonna be 'cos she's legally blonde
You gotta fight to be legally blonde
You gotta fight to be legally blonde, yeah

Paulette, I've got another package
Thanks, Kyle B. O'Boyle
Hey, what does the 'B' stand for?
Brendan

Back in the game
Back in the fray
Get the hell outta the way, outta the way
Mister, you're fired

What? Guess who I hired? Who?
To represent me, you gotta be, yeah, you gotta be
Yeah, you gotta be, yeah, you better be

Legally blonde, legally blonde, oh yeah
Legally blonde, legally blonde, oh yeah
Legally blonde, legally blonde, oh yeah
Legally blonde, oh yeah

Though I dreamed of this day long ago
Now my answer is thank you, but no
Look, I've barely begun, I'm hardly through

I was living in ignorant bliss
Till I learned I could be more than this
And you know, in a way I owe it all to you

I thought losing your love was a blow
I could never withstand
Look how far I have come without
Anyone holding my hand

I had to find my way
The day you broke my heart
You handed me the chance
To make a brand new start

You helped me find my way
There's still so much to learn
So many dreams to earn
But even if I crash and burn ten times a day

I think I'm here to stay
I'm gonna find my way

William Shakespeare wrote
"To thine own self be true
And it must follow as the night the day
Thought cans't not then be false to any man"

I believe this wise statement best applies to a woman, a blonde woman
Over the past three years, she taught me and showed us
All that being true to yourself never goes out of style
Ladies and gentlemen, our valedictorian, Elle Woods

Ladies and gentlemen of the class of
Here's the part where she gives her big speech
We're so proud, but Elle's not one to preach
So she said we can play "Where are they now?"
Here we go

Enid practices family law, Vivienne's training for the peace corps
Warner quits and he makes more modeling anyhow
Callahan ran for governor, but was defeated of course
And his wife hired Emmett to handle their messy divorce

And me, I think I'll find my way
And hey, I married Kyle
And now we have two kids
And one more on the way

And we live out in Worcester
I bought a new salon
We also feature dog grooming
Here take a couple cards

Oops, sorry back to Elle
I thank you one and all, the ones who thought I'd fall
Who taught me how to fail, who helped me to prevail
I'm standing here today to help me find my way

Oh, and if you could give one second before we all go
Emmett Forrest, please make me the happiest woman I know

Omi, omi, omigod
Omi, omi, omi, omi, omigod
Omigod, omigod, you guys
This came out as a complete surprise
But if there ever was a perfect couple, this one qualifies

And now I found my love
Migod
I found my way to love
You guys, I finally found my prize

If there ever was a perfect couple
This one qualifies
'Cause we love you guys
No, we love you guys

Omigod
Omigod
Omigod, you guys
Omigod
